# Relational Graph

**Re**lational **Gr**aph operations with neural networks.

This library provides a language interface to create a graph by declarations of edges and nodes, as well as any constraints on the graph, against which neural network outputs bound to the graph can be evaluated.
This adds a relational overlay over elements in a network that relates physical concepts in applications.

This project is under heavy development and not yet ready to use.
