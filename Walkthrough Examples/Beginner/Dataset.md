## Dataset

### Dataset Introduction

The Spam Email Classification dataset is designed for the identification and classification of email messages into two categories: spam or not spam (often referred to as "ham"). It contains: Raw email content (including headers and body) and Labels (categorizing each email as either spam or ham).

### Task
The primary objective is to analyze the content of an email and determine whether it is spam or not. For instance, emails containing words like "lottery", "bank details", or "urgent" might be flagged as potential spam. However, the task is not so straightforward as many legitimate emails might contain these words too. An email an only be spam or not and can't be both.
