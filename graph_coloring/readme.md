# Run the experiment

```
python main.py
```

As the result you get the information of cities all being initialized to have fire station before the inference and the updated minimized solution for firestation after the inference printed out.

`main2.py` implements a set of soft constraints introduced in `graph2.py` which is still a work in progress.
