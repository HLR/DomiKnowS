## Workflows

There are built-in workflows that are commonly used in machine learning tasks. Also, user can extend the `LearningBasedProgram` class to build their own workflows.

### Initiate

A basic program can be initiate with a graph. For example:

```python
program = LearningBasedProgram(graph)
```

Additional arguments may be required for other programs.

### Train: `train()`

`train()` takes a required argument `training_set` as input. Additionally, user can provide `valid_set` and/or `test_set`. There three arguments are reader objects, which are essentially `Iterable`s. 
There are other optional arguments in `train()`.

`train()` will invoke `train_epoch()` for `train_epoch_num` times and invoke `test()` on `valid_set` if provided, for each time. And after taining is done, `test()` will be invoke with `test_set` if provided.

`Optim` specifies a optimizor class to initiate an optimizor with and be used to train the model.

Loss and metric will be store in `program.model.loss` and `program.model.mettic` for access.

Example:

```python
program.train(train_reader, test_set=test_reader, train_epoch_num=10, Optim=torch.optim.Adam)
print(program.model.loss)  # last test loss will be print
```


### Test: `test()`

Takes a reader object as input, enumerate through all the samples or batches, and update the statics of loss and metric.
Can be invoke via `train()` or used independently.
Loss, metric, and a root `DataNode` will be return.

```python
loss, metric, output = program.test(test_reader)
print(program.model.metric)
```

### Eval: `eval()`

Takes a reader object as input. Labels will be ignored. Loss and metric are also ignored. Just return the updated root `DataNode`.

## Programs

There are diffrent types of programs that can be used to train the data. `SolverPOIProgram` is the simplest program that uses only the input and label of given data to learn its parameters.

However, Domiknows can leverage the defined constraints in the graph to teach the model not to violate those constraints and in the process imrove the overall performance of the mdoel.

### IML [[1]](#1)

In order to use IML, the program should be initialized by `IMLProgram`. IMLProgram extends `LearningBasedProgram` and shares most of the same input arguments.

```python
program = IMLProgram(graph, poi=(image, ), inferTypes=['ILP', 'local/argmax'], loss=..., metric=...})
```

The only new parameter here is `inferTypes` that is set to `['ILP', 'local/argmax']`. These parameter is optional and can be used to calcualte metric.

### Priaml Dual[[2]](#2)

Primal Dual model can also be easily defined by:

```python
prgram = PrimalDualProgram( graph, Model=SolverModel, poi=(sentence, phrase, pair), inferTypes=['local/argmax'],loss=..., metric=...)
            
```

Here instead of `POImodel` we use `SolverModel`.
