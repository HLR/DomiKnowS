# Knowledge Declaration

In knowledge declaration, the user defines a collection of concepts and the way they are related to each other, representing the domain knowledge a the task.
We provide a graph language based on python for knowledge declaration with notation of "graph", "concept", "property", "relation", and "constraints".

## Class Overview

### Graph classes

- Package `regr.graph`: the set of class for above-mentioned notations as well as some base classes.
- Class `Graph`: a basic container for other components. It can contain sub-graphs for flexible modeling.
- Class `Concept`: a collection of `Property`s that can be related with each other by `Relation`s. It is a none leaf node in the `Graph`.
- Class `Property`: a key attached to a `Concept` that can be associated with certain value assigned by a sensor or a learner. It is a leaf node in the `Graph`.
- Class `Relation`: a relation between two `Concept`s. It is an edge in the `Graph`.

### Constraints classes

- Package `regr.graph.logicalConstrain`: a set of functions with logical symantics, that one can express logical constraints in first order logic.
- Function `*L()`: functions based on logical notations. Linear constraints can be generated based on the locigal constraints. Some of these functions are `ifL()`, `notL()`, `andL()`, `orL()`, `nandL()`, `existL()`, `equalL()`, etc.

## Graph

`Graph` instances are basic container of the `Concept`s, `Relation`s, constaints and other instances in the framework.
A `Graph` object is constructed either by manually coding or compiled from `OWL` (deprecated).
Each `Graph` object can contain other `Graph` objects as sub-graphs. No cyclic reference in graph hierarchy is allowed.

You can either write an owl file initializing your concepts and relations or to write your graph with our specific python classes.

Each `Graph` object can contain `Concept`s.

The graph is a partial program, and there is no sensor or learner, which are data processing units, connected. There is no behavior associated. It is only a data structure to express domain knowledge.

### Relation Types

We have three defined relationship between nodes that each program can use. `contains`, `has_a`, and `equal` are used to define relations between concepts. 

`contains` means that concept `A` is the parent node of concept `B` and several `B` instances can be the children of one single node `A`.
Whgen ever a `contains` relationship is used, it indicates a way of generating or connecting parent to children if the children are from the same type.

```python
sentence = Concept('sentence')
word = Concept('word')
phrase = Concept('phrase')

sentence.contains(word)
phrase.contains(word)
```

we use the relationship `has_a` only to define relations between concepts and to produce candidates of a relationship. For instance, a relationship between `word` and `word` can be defined using an intermediate concept `pair` and two `has_a` relation links.

```python
pair = Concept("pair")
pair.has_a(arg1=word, arg2=word)
```

This means that the candidates of a `pair` concept are generated based on a `word_{i}` and a `word_{j}`.
Considering the properties of `contains` and `has_a`, in case of defining a `semantic frame` we have to define the following code.

```python
semanic_frame = Concept('semantic-frame')
semantic_frame.has_a(verb=word, subject=word, object=word)
```

As we only support relationships between three concepts, in case of a relation with more arguments, you have to break it to relationships between a main concept and one other concept each time.

```python
semanic_frame = Concept('semantic-frame')
verb_semantic = Concept('verb-semantic')
subject_semantic = Concept('subject-semantic')
object_semantic = Concept('object-semantic')
verb_semantic.has_a(semantic=semanic_frame, verb=word)
subject_semantic.has_a(semantic=semanic_frame, subject=word)
object_semantic.has_a(semantic=semanic_frame, object=word)
```

the `equal` relation establishes an equality between two different concept. for instance, if you have two different tokenizers and you want to use features from one of them into another, you have to establish an `equal` edge between the concepts holding those tokenizer instances.

```python
word = Concept("word")
word1 = Concept("word1")
word.equal(word1)
```

This edge enables us to transfer properties of concepts between instances that are marked as equal.

Using each of these relation edges requires us to assign a sensor to them in the model execution. The sensors input is selected properties from the source concept and the output will be stored as selected properties in the destination node.

### Example

The following snippest shows an example of a `Graph`.

```python
with Graph() as graph:
    word = Concept('word')
    pair = Concept(word, word)
    with Graph('sub') as sub_graph:
        people = word('people')
        organization = word('organization')
        work_for = pair(people, organization)
```

#### Graph declaration and `with` statement

The first `with` statement creates a graph, assigns it to python variable `graph`, and declares that anything below are attached to the graph.

The second `with` statement declare another graph with an explicit name `'sub'`. It will also be attached to the enclosing graph, and become a subgraph. However, everything below this point will be attached to the subgraph, instead of the first graph.

#### Concept declaration

##### Direct declaration

`word = Concept('word')` creates a concept with name `'word'` (implicitly attached to the enclosing graph) and assign it to python variable `word`.

`pair = Concept(word, word)` is syntactic sugar to creates a concept with two `word`s being its arguments (with two `HasA` relations).
It does not has an explicit name. If a explicit name is designable, use keyword argument `name=`. For example, `pair = Concept(word, word, name='pair')`.
It will also be attached to the enclosing graph.
A `HasA` relation will be added between the new concept and each argument concept. That implies, two `HasA` concepts will be created from `pair` to `word`.
It is equivalent to the following statements:

```python
pair = Concept(name='pair')
pair.has_a(word)
pair.has_a(word)
```

##### Inherit declaration

`people = word('people')` and `organization = word('organization')` create another two concepts extending `word`, setting name `'people'` and `'organization'`, and assign them to python variable `people` and `organization`. They are attached to enclosing subgraph `sub_graph`.
Inherit declaration is syntactic sugar for creating concepts and `IsA` relations.
An `IsA` relation will be create for each of these statements. It is equivalent to the following statements:

```python
people = Concept('people')
people.is_a(word)
organization = Concept('organization')
organization.is_a(word)
```

### Access the nodes

 All the sub-`Graph`s and `Concept` instances can be retrieved from a graph (or sub-graph) with a (relative) pathname.
 For example, to retrieve `people` from the above example, one can do `graph['sub/people']` or `sub_graph['people']`.

## Constraints

The constrains are collected from three sources:

- **knowledge graph** definition, 
- **logical constrains** defined in the graph,
- **ontology (OWL file)** provided as url in the ontology graph.

*Graph Constrains*

The graph can specify constrains:

- **Subclass relation between concepts**: e.g. `people = word(name='people')` is mapped to logical expression -

  *IF(people, word)*

- **Disjointment between concepts**: e.g. `disjoint(people, organization, location, other, o)` is mapped to logical expression -

  *atMostL(people, organization, location, other, o, 1)*
  
- **Domain and ranges for relations**: e.g. `work_for.has_a(people, organization)` is mapped to logical expressions-

  *ifL(work_for, V(name='x'), andL(people, V(v=('x', rel_pair_phrase1.name)), organization, V(v=('x', rel_pair_phrase2.name))))*

*Logical Constrains*

They express constrains between concepts defined in the graph using logical and counting constructs.

The basic building block  of the logical constrain contain the `name` of the concept followed by the optional instance of `V` class which can either have a variable assigning to this concept through attribute `name` and can also provide information how elements will be selected for the concept during logical constrain  computing, trough the `v` attribute. This attribute can specify an previously defined variable and the path from this  variable through relation links to elements selected for this concept.

These basic blocks are combined using the following logical functions to build logical expression:

- `notL()`,
- `andL()`,
- `orL()`,
- `nandL()`,
- `ifL()`,
- `norL()`,
- `xorL()`,
- `epqL()`,
- `eqL()`, -  used to select, for the logical constrain, instances with value for specified attribute in the provided set or equal to the provided value, e.g.: 

*eqL(cityLink, 'neighbor', {True})* - instances of *cityLink* with attribute *neighbor* in the set containing only single value True,

- `existsL()`, e.g.: 

*existsL(firestationCity)* - *firestationCity* exists,

- `exactL(firestationCity)`, e.g.:

*exactL(firestationCity, 2)* - exists exactly 2 *firestationCity*,

- `atLeastL()`, e.g.:

*atLeastL(firestationCity, 4)* - exists at least 4 *firestationCity*,

- `atMostL()`,  e.g.:

*atMostL(andL(city, V(name='x'), firestationCity, V(v=('x', eqL(cityLink, 'neighbor', {True}), city2))), 4)* - each city has no more then 4 *neighbors*.

The logical constrain can use variables to associate related objects of the logical expression.
The expressions use concepts defined in the graph and set additional constrains on them.

The constrains are regular Python instructions thus they have to follow definition of tuple in Python.

*Ontology*

The OWL ontology, on which the learning system graph was build is loaded into the `ilpOntSolver` and parsed using python OWL library [owlready2](https://pythonhosted.org/Owlready2/).

The OWL ontology language allows to specify constrains on [classes](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Classes "OWL Class") and [properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Object_Properties "OWL Property"). These classes and properties relate to concepts and relations which the learning system builds classification model for. The solver extracts these constrains.

This detail of mapping from OWL to logical representation is presented below for each OWL constrain.
