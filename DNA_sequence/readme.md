The generation of DNA sequences and further classification of them into specific gene categories is an important task in bioinformatics, with significant implications for genetics, medicine, and biotechnology. In this research, we aim to do this by taking advantage of symbolic knowledge, relevant to DNAs, which is expressed by experts in this field. We use the DomiKnowS framework, which is a tool designed for integrating symbolic domain knowledge into deep learning models. This framework provides both a Python library for the utilization of its modules and a website interface that, through step-by-step interactions with the user, creates a knowledge graph that incorporates the domain knowledge. This framework requires the definition of a knowledge graph, machine learning modules, and training methods. As such, we begin by declaring domain knowledge about DNA sequences, including the nucleotide bases and their arrangement rules, and the classification criteria for six distinct gene categories which forms our knowledge graph. This domain knowledge is then integrated into various machine learning models implemented in PyTorch. These models are trained on a DNA sequence dataset sourced from Kaggle. The performance of the DomiKnowS models is evaluated and compared against baseline models lacking domain knowledge integration. The results provide insights into the benefits of integrating symbolic knowledge in deep learning for bioinformatics applications.
