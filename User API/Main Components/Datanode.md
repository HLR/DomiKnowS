## DataNode and Data Graph

Example in the learning process has its Data Graph built based on sensors included in the model.
The example is usually partitioned by sensors into a different types of elements corresponding to different concepts from the [knowledge graph](KNOWLEDGE.md).

Each example element has its own DataNode build which is linked to other Data Nodes in the Data Graph corresponding to other elements from the example through relation links. The Data Node stores the following information about the token:

- **ontology concepts**  - of the element from the associated [knowledge graph](KNOWLEDGE.md),

- **id** - of the element, unique in the scope of all elements of the given knowledge concept type,

- **relation links**  - for this element, it is a dictionary with names of relations and references to related DataNodes,

- **impact links** - for the element, it is a dictionary with references of DataNodes impacting this DataNode by having it as a subject of their relations,

- **attributes** - of the element, it is a dictionary with key corresponding to the sensor which produced the given attribute and the output value of the given sensor.

DataNode methods facilitate access to its content:

- **children**: `getChildDataNodes(conceptName=None)`

The method returns a list of DataNode children DataNode (related to the DataNode though contains relation). If *conceptName* parameter is provided then only DataNodes of the given type are returned. The example:

```python
getChildDataNodes(conceptName=char) # get all children DataNode with *char* type
```

- **relations**: `getRelationLinks(relationName=None)`

The method returns a list of related DataNode. If *relationName* is provided only DataNodes related through the given relation are returned. The example:

```python
getRelationLinks(relationName=pair) # get list of related DataNodes through *pair* relation
```
 
- **attributes**: `getAttribute(*keys)`

The method returns the value of the attribute. The *keys* are concatenated into a single key string used to access the attribute in the DataNode. The example:

```python
getAttribute(work_for, 'ILP')* - get value of the attribute storing the result of the ILP solver solution for the concept *work_for*
```

### Data Graph Query

The Data Graph can be queried for specific DataNodes using the method called on any DataNode in the graph:

```python
findDatanodes(dns = None, select = None, indexes = None)
```

The method returns the list of DataNodes satisfying the query provided in the *select* argument, additionally the *indexes* argument can specify queries for related data nodes which have to be satisfied by the returned Data Nodes.

The data nodes are searched in the graph starting from the DataNode on which this method is called and below it.
The examples:

- **dataNode.findDatanodes(select = word)** - find all dataNodes of type *word*

- **dataNode.findDatanodes(select = (char, 'raw', 'J'))** - find dataNode of type *char* with with *raw* attribute equal *J*

- **dataNode.findDatanodes(select = word,  indexes = {"contains" : (char, 'raw', 'J')** - find dataNodes of type *word* and containing char with *raw* attribute equal *J*

- **dataNode.findDatanodes(select = word,  indexes = {"contains" : ((char, 'raw', 'o'), (char, 'raw', 'h'))** - find dataNodes of type *word* and containing dataNode of type *char* with *raw* attribute equal *o* and dataNode of type*char* with *raw* attribute equal *h*

- **dataNode.findDatanodes(select = pair, indexes = {"arg1" : 0, "arg2": 3})** - find dataNode of type *pair* linking dataNodes with id 0 and 3

- **dataNode.findDatanodes(select = pair, indexes = {"arg1" : (word, 'raw', 'John'), "arg2": (word, 'raw', "IBM")})** - find dataNode of type *pair* linking dataNode of type *word* with *raw* attribute equal *John* and dataNode of type *word* with *raw* attribute equal *IBM*

### Data Graph construction

Class **DataNodeBuilder** builds Data Graph consisting of DataNodes during the learning process based on the sensor context update.
The dataNodes a populated based on the concepts in the graph and each dataNodes atttributes are also update from the value associated to the corresponding concepts' property.

Each sensor has its context dictionary implemented with the object of DataNodeBuilder class which also implements Dictionary interface but overloads its methods.
It creates Data Graph based on sensors' context update.

The overloaded method:

```python
__setitem__(self, key, value)
```

updates the created DataNode with information submitted to the dictionary by the sensors.

The *key* is assumed to be a `str`, `Sensor`, or `Property`.

- `str` key

For `str` key, it is used for general purpose data storage, for example, the result of data reader. The `DataNodeBuilder` instance is initialized by a `data_item` from data reader, and all the keys (and corresponding values) in `data_item` are stored it.
It can be used to store other resources by string keys.

- Sensor` key

When a `Sensor` instance is used as a key, it will trigger an creation/update to dataNodes.
If there is no dataNode of this sensor's concept, dataNodes will be created first.
The value of the sensor will be used to update the dataNodes' attributes.
The attributes will has the same name as the sensor's property.

If the sensor is an `EdgeSensor`, relation link will be updated based on the source and destination of the `EdgeSensor`.

- `Property` key

When a `Property` instance is used as a key, it is just to serve the retrieval shortcut based on `property`.
Our design is update value by sensors and retrieve value by properties. Every time a sensor update its value, it will pass the value to the builder with itself as key and also its property as key. So other sensor can retrieve this value by just query the propery.
However, the dataNode builder will just store the value for properties and won't trigger updating to dataNodes based on property key, because updates of sensor key already include all creation and updating activity.

#### Values

The values provided to the builder is interprete as a ordered collection of attributes values that are to be distributed to each dataNode of the associated concept.
Basically, it should be a python `list` or a`torch.Tensor`.
If a list is assigned, the length of the list must match the number of dataNodes of this concept and each element in this list, whatever type it is, should be associated to the attribute of a dataNode in the same order as the dataNode index order.
If a tensor is provided, the first dimension of the sensor must match the number of dataNodes of this concept and each "row" containing the rest of dimension should be associated to the attribute of a dataNode in the same order as the dataNode index order.

Examples:

```python
sentence['text'] = DummySensor00()
# sensor return:
['John works for IBM .']

sentence['ids'] = DummySensor01()
# sensor return:
tensor([[48, 97, 72, 9, 83]])  # shape = (1,5)
```

Where `DummySensor00` returns a list of only one `str`, indicating there is only one sentence dataNode. The sentence dataNode has a `'text'` attribute with `'John works for IBM .'`.
`DummySensor01` returns a tensor where the first dimension is 1, which also match the only one sentence. Then the vector `tensor([48, 97, 72, 9, 83])` should be associated with the sentence.

```python
word['text'] = DummySensor02()
# sensor return:
['John', 'works', 'for', 'IBM', '.']

word['emb'] = DummySensor03()
# sensor return:
tensor([[0.63, 1.12, ..., -0.83],
        [0.05, -0.94, ..., 2.72],
        [0.91, 0.24, ..., 0.12],
        [0.84, -0.22, ..., -0.72],
        [0.08, 1.10, ..., 0.01]])  # shape = (5,100)
```

Here `DummySensor02` returns a list of 5 `str`s. Each of them will be associated with a corresponding word dataNode in `'text'` attribute.
`DummySensor03`, similarly, returns a tensor of whose first dimension if 5. Each raw of the 100-dim vector will be associated with a word dataNode in `emb` attribute.
For instance, the second dataNode of word have `'text'` attribute as string `'work'` and `'emb'` attribute as tensor `tensor([0.05, -0.94, ..., 2.72])`.

#### DataNode(s) for concept

If the *<conceptOrRelationName>* part of the *key* is a *concept* from the  [knowledge graph](KNOWLEDGE.md) then the **DataNodeBuilder** analysis the *value* and determines how many elements of the type specified by the third part of the *key* will be created or updated by this *value*.
The *value* is assumed to provide **single element** (contribute to single DataNode) if the value is:
- not Tensor or List, e.g. string,
- Tensor but of the dimension equals 0,
- Tensor or List of length 1 and with dimension 1.
- Tensor of length 2 but its key *attributeKey* part has first word embedded in '<' - such a tensor represent a single set of two probabilities (negative and positive).

In this case a single new DataNode is created or updated (if the DataNode already exists).
If the single DataNode is determined to be for created for the *root* concept then the *READER* key is used as the new DataNode id, if the key is not set then the id is set to 0.

#### DataNode creation

When the builder receives an update to a sensor whose concept's dataNode are not yet initiated, the builder will create them first.

The *value* determine how many new DataNodes are created.
If the value is a list, then dataNodes are created based on the length of the list. If the value is a tensor, then dataNodes are created based on the first dimension of the tensor. Each dataNode will be initiated with an index which indicated its matching with elements in the list or "row" in the tensor.

The *value* cannot be **None** otherwise the *set* method logs an error and returns.

#### DataNode Attribute Update

The subsequent submission *values* length need to match the number of DataNodes created for the given concept or relation.

So for instance: Tensor with shape[3,7,4] will update 3 dataNodes each with Tensor of shape[7,4].

In order to assign attribute value to dataNode created with Tensor with shape[3,4] the tensor will need to have it first shape element equal 12.

#### Relation link Update

Datanodes-wise relation links are also build based on the value passed to builder with `Sensor` keys.
The the key is an `EdgeSensor`, the relation link will be create/update.
A relation (between concepts in the graph) will be associated to the edge sensor, with another argument `mode='forward'|'backward'` which indicates the direction for the sensor.
The `dst` of the sensor is always the sensor's concept and the `src` of the sensor indicates the other end of the relation. `relation` of sensor is used to indicates which relation link to be udpated.
The relation is represented as a matrix tensor, whose first dimension represents the number of dataNodes of `dst` concept and the second dimension matches the number of `src` concept's dataNodes.

Example:

```oython
word[phrace_contains_word.forward] = DummyEdgeSensor10()
# sensor return:
tensor([[1, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]])  # shape = (5, 4)
```

Here `phrace_contains_word.forward` helps `DummyEdgeSensor10` to identify the relation and the forward/backward mode to be used. In this example, the sensor's `src` is the concept `phrase` and `dst` is the concept `word`, which matches the concept we are assign property to.

The return value of the sensor is a 5 by 4 matrix which indicates the existence of relation link between dataNodes by ones, and the rest are zeros.
The first dimension 5 indicates there should be 5 words. And the second dimension 4 matches the number of phrase dataNodes.
In this example, the matrix is indicating that, word with index 0 is connected to phrase 0, the word 1 and 2 is connected to phrase 1, word 3 is connected to phrase 2, and word 4 is connecting to phrase 3.
This format is used consistently for 1-to-1, 1-to-many, many-to-1, and many-to-many relation.

If this is the first property that is populated by the data for the concept, it will also trigger the creation of dataNodes. Otherwise, the dimensions must be matching, as mention above.

Multiple relations can be used at the same time.

```python
pair[pair_arg1.backward, pair_arg2.backward] = DummyEdgeSensor11()
# for example, the sensor will filter out self-connected pair of word
# sensor return first element:
tensor([[1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        ...,
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        ...,
        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
        ...,
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
        ...])  # shape = (20,5)
# sensor return second element:
tensor([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
        ...])  # shape = (20,5)
```

Where the matrix dimension implies there are 20 dataNode instances of `pair`, and each is to be connected with word dataNodes separately.

In this example, the 7th pair's arguments it is as simple as to get the 7th row from `pair[pair_arg1.backward]`

```python
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]  #  indicating the second word
```

and 7th from `pair[pair_arg2.backward]`

```python
        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]  #  indicating the fourth word
```

#### Returning Constructed DataNodes

There are two methods returning constructed dataNodes.

- the fist DataNode in the list is returned by the method:

```python
getDataNode(self)
```

- all constructed DataNodes are returned by the method:

```python
getBatchDataNodes(self)
```

#### DataNode logging

*DataNode* and *DataNodeBuilde*r log their activities, warning and errors to a log file.
The *path* to the log file is printed to the program standard output.

The example of log from the DataNodeBuilder activity is provided below:
