# DomiKnowS: Declarative Knowledge Integration with Deep Neural Models

DomiKnowS is a Python library that facilitates the integration of domain knowledge in deep learning architectures. With DomiKnowS, you can express the structure of your data symbolically via graph declarations and seamlessly add logical constraints over outputs or latent variables to your deep models. This allows you to define domain knowledge explicitly, improving your models' explainability, performance, and generalizability, especially in low-data regimes. 

While several approaches for integrating symbolic and sub-symbolic models have been introduced, no generic library facilitates programming for such integration with various underlying algorithms. DomiKnowS aims to simplify the programming for knowledge integration in training and inference phases while separating the knowledge representation from learning algorithms.
