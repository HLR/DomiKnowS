There is a small black triangle far to the right of both small blue objects. The black triange is near and above a medium blue square. The medium blue square is touching the right edge of A and is near and above a medium black circle. Near and to the right of the medium black circle is a medium yellow triangle. The yellow triangle is to the left of the small blue circle. In B, which is to the right of A, there is a large blue square near and to the left of a large yellow triangle. There is also a small yellow triangle far below the square. In C, which is to the right of B. there is a small yellow circle near and above a small yellow triangle. The small yellow triangle is touching the top of a medium black triangle. The black triangle is touching the right edge of C. There is a large blue circle far below the black triangle."
