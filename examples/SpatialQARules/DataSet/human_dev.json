In B, there is a large blue circle, a small black circle, and a yellow square. The blue circle is touching the bottom and right edges of B. The yellow square is to the left of the blue circle. The small black circle is above both the blue circle and yellow square. In C, there are three triangles, a large black one, a blue one, and a small yellow one. The large black one is touching the right edge of C. The blue one is touching the bottom of C and is to the right of the yellow one.

In B, there are four yellow squares, three medium ones and a small one. The medium squares are above each other with the top one touching the right edge of B and the bottom one touching the bottom of B. The small yellow square is near and to the left of the bottom medium square There is also a small black square near to the left of the small yellow square. There is another block called C, Which is to the right of B. In C, there is a yellow triangle Which is far to the right of a yellow square."
