#### are_keys_new(given_dict, dict_list)

Check if all keys in ‘given_dict’ are not present in any dictionary within ‘dict_list’.

This method iterates over each key in ‘given_dict’ and checks if it exists in any of the dictionaries
contained within ‘dict_list’. If a key from ‘given_dict’ is found in any dictionary in ‘dict_list’,
the method returns False, indicating that not all keys are new. Otherwise, it returns True,
indicating all keys in ‘given_dict’ are new (i.e., not present in any dictionary in ‘dict_list’).

Parameters:

found_variables (dict): Dictionary containing all variables that have been defined.

> The key is the variable name and the value is a tuple containing information
> about the variable.

used_variables (dict, optional): Dictionary to store variables that are used. The key is the variable name,
: and the value is a list of tuples, each containing the logical constraint,
  variable name, the type of the element that uses it, and the path to the variable.
  Defaults to None.

headLc (str, optional): The name of the parent logical constraint. Defaults to None.

Returns:
dict: A dictionary containing all used variables.

Raises:
Exception: If there are variables that are used but not defined, or if there are errors in the path definitions.

#### check_path(path, resultConcept, variableConceptParent, lc_name, foundVariables, variableName)

Checks the validity of a path in terms of relations and concepts.

#### collectVarMaps(lc, varMapsList)

Collects variable mappings (VarMaps) from a logical constraint (lc) and updates the list of collected VarMaps.

This method recursively traverses the elements of the logical constraint ‘lc’ to identify and process VarMaps.
It differentiates between the definition of new variables and the usage of existing ones. For new variables, 
it clones the current VarMap, adds the name of the logical constraint, and appends it to ‘varMapsList’. For 
existing variables, it updates the path variable in the current VarMap to match the one used in their 
definition. The method modifies ‘lc’ by removing VarMaps that define new variables.

Parameters:
lc (LogicalConstrain): The logical constraint from which VarMaps are to be collected.
varMapsList (list): A list that accumulates VarMaps. This list collects only the definitions of variables.

Returns:
list: The updated list of variable mappings (VarMaps) after processing ‘lc’.

Note:
- The method assumes the existence of specific types and structures within ‘lc’, such as ‘VarMaps’ tuples.
- The method is recursive and alters the structure of ‘lc’ by removing defining VarMaps.

Returns:
Any: The root concept or relation.

Raises:
AttributeError, TypeError: If the attribute ‘is_a’ is not available or if the type is incorrect.

#### findConceptInfo(concept)

Finds and returns various information related to a given concept.

This method compiles a dictionary containing different attributes and relations of the concept. 
It looks for the ‘has_a’, ‘contains’, and ‘is_a’ relationships and also identifies if the concept is a root.

Args:
concept (Any): The concept for which information is to be found. The type depends on the implementation.

Returns:
OrderedDict: A dictionary containing the following keys:

> - ‘concept’: The original concept.
> - ‘relation’: Boolean indicating if the concept has a ‘has_a’ relationship.
> - ‘has_a’: List of ‘has_a’ relations.
> - ‘relationAttrs’: An ordered dictionary of relation attributes.
> - ‘contains’: List of concepts that the original concept contains.
> - ‘containedIn’: List of concepts that contain the original concept.

#### find_lc_variable(lc, found_variables=None, headLc=None)

Finds all variables defined in a logical constraint and reports errors for duplicates.

This method traverses through the elements of a logical constraint to find all the variables 
that have been defined. It checks for incorrect cardinality definitions, multiple definitions of the 
same variable, and variables that are not associated with any concept among other things.

Args:
lc (LogicalConstrain): The logical constraint to be processed.
found_variables (dict, optional): Dictionary to store found variables. The key is the variable name,

> and the value is a tuple containing the logical constraint, variable name, 
> and the concept associated with the variable.
> Defaults to None.

headLc (str, optional): The name of the parent logical constraint. Defaults to None.

Returns:
dict: A dictionary containing all found variables.

Raises:

#### handleVarsPath(lc, varMaps)

Processes and updates the variable paths in a logical constraint (lc) based on the mappings provided in varMaps.

This method iterates through the elements of ‘lc’ and performs various transformations based on the type
of each element and the presence of variable mappings in ‘varMaps’. The method handles nested logical 
constraints recursively, updates variables already in V form, and modifies variable paths using mappings 
from ‘varMaps’. Additionally, it removes all ‘VarMaps’ elements from ‘lc’.

Parameters:
lc (LogicalConstrain): The logical constraint to be processed.
varMaps (dict): A dictionary containing mappings of variable names to their respective V instances or paths.

Note:
- The method assumes a specific structure of ‘lc’ and ‘varMaps’, with ‘lc’ containing elements like
