# DataNode and Data Graph

Every example in the learning process has its Data Graph built based on sensors included in the model.
The example is partitioned by sensors into a different types of tokens corresponding to different linguistic concepts from the ontology graph.

Each example token has its own Data Node build which is linked to other Data Nodes in the Data Grpah corresponding to other tokens from the example through relation links. The Data Node stores the following information about the token:

* **ontology concepts**  - from the associated ontology graph,
* **id** - unique in the scope of all tokens of the given ontology concept type,
* **relation links** dictionary with names of relations and related Data Nodes,
* **impact links** dictionary with dataNodes impacting this datanode by having it as a subject of its relation
* **attributes** dictionary - with key corresponding to the sensor which produced the given attribute and its value for the given token.

DataNode methods facilitate access to its content:

* **children**:
  ```default
    getChildDataNodes(conceptName=None)
  ```

The method returns a list of DataNode children DataNode. If *conceptName* is provided only DataNodes of the given ontologicall type are returned. The example:

getChildDataNodes(conceptName=char)\* - get all children DataNode with *char* type

* **relations**:
  ```default
    getRelationLinks(relationName=None)
  ```

The method returns a list of related DataNode. If *relationName* is provided only DataNodes related through the given relation are returned. The example:

getRelationLinks(relationName=pair)\* - get list of related DataNodes through *pair* relation

* **attributes**:
  ```default
    getAttribute(*keys)
  ```

The method returns the value of the attribute. The *keys* are connected into a single key used to access the attribute in the DataNode. The example:

getAttribute(work\_for, ‘ILP’)\* - get value of the attribute storing the result of the ILP solver solution for the concept *work\_for*

##Data Graph Query

The Data Graph can be queried for specific data nodes using the method called on any Data Node:

```default
	findDatanodes(dns = None, select = None, indexes = None)
```

The method returns the list of DataNodes satisfying the query provided in the *select* argument, additionally the *indexes* argument can specify queries for related data nodes which have to be satisfied by the returned Data Nodes.

The data nodes are searched in the graph starting from the DataNode on which this method is called and below it.
The examples:

* **datanode.findDatanodes(select = word)** - find all dataNodes of type *word*
* **datanode.findDatanodes(select = (char, ‘raw’, ‘J’))** - find dataNode of type *char* with with *raw* attribute equal *J*
* **datanode.findDatanodes(select = word,  indexes = {”contains” : (char, ‘raw’, ‘J’)** - find dataNodes of type *word* and containing char with *raw* attribute equal *J*
* **datanode.findDatanodes(select = word,  indexes = {”contains” : ((char, ‘raw’, ‘o’), (char, ‘raw’, ‘h’))** - find dataNodes of type *word* and containing dataNode of type *char* with *raw* attribute equal *o* and dataNode of type*char* with *raw* attribute equal *h*
* **datanode.findDatanodes(select = pair, indexes = {”arg1” : 0, “arg2”: 3})** - find dataNode of type *pair* linking dataNodes with id 0 and 3
* **datanode.findDatanodes(select = pair, indexes = {”arg1” : (word, ‘raw’, ‘John’), “arg2”: (word, ‘raw’, “IBM”)})** - find dataNode of type *pair* linking dataNode of type *word* with *raw* attribute equal *John* and dataNode of type *word* with *raw* attribute equal *IBM*

# Data Graph construction

Class **DataNodeBuilder** builds Data Graph consisting of DataNodes during the learning process based on the sensor context update. Each sensor has its previous context dictionary replaced with the object of DataNodeBuilder class which also implements Dictionary interace but olerladed its methods and created Data Graph based on sensor context update.

The primary overloaded method is:

```default
__setitem__(self, key, value)
```

The method assumes that key idetifies the sensor and the value is a tensor of approperiate dimension.
